          <h2>Mythology and symbolism</h2>
          <p>Delia Lin, from the department of Chinese Studies at Melbourne University, says that while there are general principles around the symbolism of the Water Tiger, there are also many characteristics that no one really agrees upon.</p>
          <p>"Different people attach different characteristics to it, it has to do with tradition, it has to do with the persons belief — basically interpretation," Dr Lin says.</p>
          <p>It's also worth noting that the Lunar New Year is celebrated by people from many different Asian cultures, and traditions around the holiday vary.</p>
          <p>There is, however, more of a consensus around the significance of the tiger in Chinese culture, its meaning as a Zodiac sign, and what one can expect from a Tiger year.</p>
          <p>Fengqi Qian, a lecturer in Chinese at Deakin University, says that tigers have a very special place in Chinese culture, given that China has been the home and origin of many different species.</p>
          <p>The tiger is considered the king of all animals in Chinese mythology and culture. Dr Lin says that as a Zodiac sign, it symbolises power, courage, confidence, leadership and strength.</p>
          <p>It's also known to be an animal that expels all evil.</p>
          <p>Because of this, there is often a sense of fear around the tiger, and it can be associated with destruction. Dr Qian says, however, that it's also associated with good luck, bravery, and good health and wellbeing.</p>
          <p>In terms of the Tiger Year, it's associated with vitality and strength.</p>

          <h2>How do we get a Water Tiger year?</h2>

          <p>To answer this, we need to take a look at the Chinese lunar calendar, which has been in use for thousands of years.</p>
          <p>The calendar is based around two systems: the 'heavenly' stems and the 'earthly' branches. The earthly branches are comprised of 12 zodiac signs, each represented by an animal, which you've probably heard of. They are the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog and pig.</p>
          <p>What's less commonly known is the zodiacs' interaction with the heavenly stems.</p>
          <p>The heavenly stems are comprised of the numbers 1–10, with each number representing one of the five elements of Taoism: wood, fire, earth, metal and water.</p>
          <p>"From the match of the 10 numbers with the 12 signs, comes the name of each particular year," Dr Qian says.</p>
          <p>This year is number nine, which represents water. It's combined with the third zodiac sign, the tiger, which gives us a water tiger. The last water tiger year was in 1962.</p>
          <p>While projections of what each new lunar year brings changes from year to year, and perspectives on the holiday will differ slightly from country to country, Dr Lin says that the key idea remains the same:</p>
          <p>"It's all about seeing out the old, and welcoming in the new," says Dr Lin.</p>
